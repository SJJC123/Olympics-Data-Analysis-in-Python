# Olympics-Data-Analysis-in-Python

This is an exploratory data analysis in Python that covers data from the Olympics (1896 - 2016). In this project, I utilize various Python libraries, like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy to navigate, manipulate, and gain useful insight out of the data. The data analysis covers aspects such as participation in Summer vs Winter Olympics, participation based on sex, taking a look at the top medal recipients, and more. Below is a run down of the files and what they are for:

Olympics Data Analysis.html - A quick view of the Python code and graphs I created using the datasets. Helpful if you do not want to download the ipynb file.

Olympics Data Analysis.ipynb - The Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code and analytical graphs that were created.

athlete_events.csv.zip - A zip file containing the larger part of the dataset. Just download the zip file and open it uo to reveal a roughly 40MB file on the athletes, events, countries, and more.

noc_regions.csv - The other part of the dataset that contains country names as well. I joined this dataset with athlete_events.csv in the Python code for easier usability.
